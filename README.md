>What is the Internet?

The Internet is a network of networks. 
Now a network is two or more computers connected
together to share resources, or to communicate
with each other.

â€¢ There are two main types of networks: LAN and
WAN

LAN(local Area Network)are usually a small collection of computers sharing
resources. (Typically a LAN is confined to a small geographic area. School,
home etc.)

WANS (Wide Area Network) connect larger geographic areas like California, the United States, or
the world.

# WEB vs Internet 
Do not confuse the Internet with the web!
Web is part of the Internet.
Web is the resource of particular kinds of
documents on the Internet.
The Internet is the vast collection of computer
networks and resources. Much of the data
exchanged on the Internet has nothing to do with
the web.
